Repository for the Emerging Technologies Module.

<b>All work will be posted to this repository</b> 

## Introduction
For the <b>50669 -- EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES</b> module, a GitHub repository must be created the must contain the following content to a sufficent level:
 * Two Jupyter Notebooks which discuss:
   * A demonstration of Scikit-Learn and at least three interesting scikit-learn algorithms.
   * A clear and concise comparison of quantum computing and classical computing as well as an explanation of Deutschâ€™s algorithm and code simulating it using <i>qiskit</i>.

 * A comprehensive GitHub repository that conatins:
   * A clear and informative README.md explaining why the repository exists, what is
     in it, and how to run the notebooks.
   * A Dockerfile and/or a docker-compose.yml file that enables someone to quickly
     run your notebooks with minimal configuration. You should also include any other
     required files, such as a requirements.txt file, data files, and image files.
     
 The content of this introduction was taken directly from the project brief for ease of use and review purposes.
