    "A quantum computer utilises quantum mechanics to produce processing power unlike what typical computers are capable of producing. While traditional computers use bits which can be set to either 0 or 1,  quantum computers use qubits, which are similar to electrons or photons as they are all subatomic particles. Qubits possess various properties that make them stand out from their binary counterpart, especially when there are a connected group of them. A group of qubits can provide way more processing power than the same number of binary bits.  \n",

    "### Superposition\n",
    "Qubits possess the unique ability to represent numerous possible combinations of 0 or 1 which is what seperates them from the traditional bit. This property of the qubit is called superposition. Qubits can be manipulated to be placed in their superposition state by using precision lasers or microwave beams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculations can be solved exponentially faster with a quantum computer when several qubits in are put into superposition. The final result of a calculation emerges only once the qubits are measured, which immediately causes their state to collapse back into either a 0 or 1.\n",

    "### Entanglement\n",
    "Pairs of qubits can be \"entangled\". This means that two qubits thats are a pair can be put into a single quantum state. If the state of one of the qubits is changed, the other quibit will instantaneously change to the state of the opposite one. Distance does not affect the entanglement of two bits, so a pair of qubits will change even if the distance is vast. \n"
